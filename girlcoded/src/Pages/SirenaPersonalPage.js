Raspberry Pi used to handle chess logic (using Stockfish chess engine), board state, and Firebase communication (for user authentication and database), with Node.js for server to run Stockfish engine on the web application",

Created an RFID key-fob scanning attendance system that verifies the ownerâ€™s validity against the existing database of valid UIDs, and uses LEDs, an LCD display, and a buzzer to signal if the owner is allowed access. Used the MFRC522 Library for Arduino to read and write RFID. Used PLX-DAQ for Arduino to Excel for real-time serial data communication",
